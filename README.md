## Upgrading

Fetch upstream, merge with tag, test locally if necessary, push to git with tag to test on staging.

```sh
git checkout master && git pull origin master
git fetch upstream
git merge $TAGNAME
# Resolve any merge conflicts, then test locally if it feels necessary.
git commit -a # Use auto-generated commit message.
# Copy commit hash and update `MASTO_HAS` in Dockerfile.
git commit -am "Releasing Docker image for $TAGNAME."
git tag $RELEASE_TAG_NAME
git push origin $RELEASE_TAG_NAME
# Verify release is building on Docker Hub. Take a break, it'll be a while.
```

## Deploying

Deploying **must always** be done to the staging server first.

New tags and branches on the repo are [built on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ashfurrow/mastodon/). Once built, edit `docker-compose.yml`. The Docker tags are the same as the git tags, so the compose file should be changed to point to that new tag name.

```sh
# ssh'd into a server in the `mastodon` folder.
vim docker-compose.yml # edit `image:` values to point to $RELEASE_TAG_NAME.
docker-compose up -d
# Test, verify things work (see preflight checklist).
```

## Preflight Checklist

Before deploying to production, test on staging. Here's a list:

- [ ] Test that you can toot.
- [ ] Test that you can upload media with a toot.

If you ever run into anything that breaks on production, after fixing it make sure to add it to this list.
